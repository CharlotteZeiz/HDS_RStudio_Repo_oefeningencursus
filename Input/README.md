# HDS_RStudio_Repo_oefeningencursus
 
As before, check the GitHub course repository issue. The work below should be done as part of a new GitHub repository (an RStudio Project), organised in appropriate folders.
For this week's exercise, download and work through the attached R markdown file (R_read-data.Rmd), which will introduce you to objects, packages and functions used to read in data. You will also need to download the two data files fev.csv (which contains a toy dataset of demographic data, smoking status and measured forced expiratory volume) and psa.txt (another toy dataset, the exact content doesn't matter at all).
Remember to tick off each item on the course repository issue as you complete them!
